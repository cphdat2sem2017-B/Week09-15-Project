# Architecture and documentation
On Tuesday and Wednesday May 2. and 5. we will look at architecture and its documentation.

For Tuesday there is an extract from a book. I have tried to pick out the parts which are most relevant for your project and exam. Tuesday will be mostly theory.

For Wednesday we will look at the tool called Javadoc, which is used to produce documentation of methods, classes, packages and projects. Wednesday will be a lot of workshop.

Readings:

- [Lethbridge and Laganiere chapter 9](arch-LethbridgeLaganiereExtract.pdf)
- [Note on Javadoc](arch-Javadoc.md)
- [Note on Javadoc in Netbeans](arch-JavadocNetbeans.md)
