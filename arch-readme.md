# Architecture and documentation
On Monday and Tuesday November 21. and 22. we will look at architecture and its documentation.

For Monday there is an extract from a book. I have tried to pick out the parts which are most relevant for your project and exam. Monday will be mostly theory.

For Tuesday we will look at the tool called Javadoc, which is used to produce documentation of methods, classes, packages and projects. Tuesday will be a lot of workshop.

Readings:

- [Lethbridge and Laganiere chapter 9](arch-LethbridgeLaganiereExtract.pdf)
- [Note on Javadoc](arch-Javadoc.md)
- [Note on Javadoc in Netbeans](arch-JavadocNetbeans.md)
